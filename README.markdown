Small project. Implements a dictionary in C.

It can store any pointer. Only tested on OSX for now.

Initialize using `dict_create`. This takes in a single argument, which for now is DICT_INT (for integers) or DICT_STR (for strings). You must pass a pointer when you insert (will be fixing this soon to support integers without passing a pointer). It is still in development, so if you are using a custom type, just use `DICT_INT` for now.

Lots of stuff left to do, but this is a start.
